Twitter

the script does the following:
-Autotweets using agenified tweet at a given interval in settings
-Autoreplies using agenified responses at a given interval in settings
-DevPost for direct dev posting from terminal e.g. for advertising 

It employs tweepy to initialize the resting points with a manual browser fallback 

To setup:

Go to https://developer.x.com/en 
Choose the free tier option and apply for it
Go to projects page and edit the project to obtain 

   api_key
    api_secret
     access_token
      access_token_secret
       bearer_token
        client_id
         client_secret

and your username and password

place them into the relevant fields in settings tab or settings.py if doing it manually
(while not entirely necessary it does aid with compliance of twitter new rules that nuke graphql users accounts)

Also please do the following
-if the twitter account is new post 12 tweets and 6 replies to reduce filter loads to agents
-Switch to bot mode account to reduce bans
